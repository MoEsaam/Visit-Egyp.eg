            Information about the monastery:</h2>
            On the slopes of Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Ten Commandments from God, is located one of the oldest working monasteries in the world. Commonly known as Saint Catherine's Monastery, its actual name is "The Holy Monastery of God on Mount Sinai". It was built by order of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (527-565 AD) in 548-565 AD to house the monks who had been living in the Sinai Peninsula since the fourth century AD.

            St. Catherine was martyred in the early fourth century AD, as the monastery bears her name because her monks discovered her body near Mount St. Catherine in the ninth century AD, where she was placed by angels after her martyrdom.
            
            The monastery includes multiple structures, the most important of which is the Church of the Transfiguration of Christ the Savior, which in itself includes nine smaller churches. One of these churches is the burning church at which God spoke to the Prophet Moses. St. Catherine's Monastery also includes ten other churches, monks' quarters, a refectory, an olive press, burial caskets, a 12th-century Fatimid mosque, and a library of rare books and 6000 manuscripts.
            <h2>Monastery history:</h2>
            The history of the monastery of St. Catherine goes back to the beginning of the fourth century, that is, before the Roman Emperor Constantine officially recognized the Christian religion and embraced Christianity. At that time, a Christian woman from Alexandria, named Catherine, became famous for her ability to persuade infidels to convert to Christianity. The Alexandria authorities tried to persuade her to abandon her lofty message, but she refused, and she was sentenced to death. But her body - as it was said - disappeared after her death and appeared on Mount Sinai. It was also said that the angels were the ones who carried him there on their wings. The Christian Church placed her in the status of saints and established a monastery on Mount Sinai in her memory. Since then, Christians from all over the Christian world have been making pilgrimages to the monastery of St. But the climb to the mountain, which is 400 meters higher than Jabal Musa, was fraught with dangers. For this reason, the tenth century AD witnessed the removal of the relics of the saint to a Christian church located near the well, where the monastery of the saint was built.
            
            The Russian books attribute the first pilgrimage the Russians made to the Sinai monastery to the monk Agrivini, who visited the monastery in 1370. The pilgrimage to the holy places in Palestine and Sinai from Russia in that era was a real feat, and it took years. Many pilgrims remained in the desert without returning home. Zosima, deacon of the Trinity and Saint Sergey Cathedral in the Moscow region, in 1419, made a pilgrimage to Sinai. He was able to return to Russia, where he published a book called "The Traveler." The Russian traveler Yeliseyev wrote in his book "The Road to Sinai" in 1881 that he met Russian peasants dressed in traditional Russian costumes in their red shirts and leather boots on the Red Sea shore. Yelisiyev said that the advantage of Russian pilgrims is simplicity, faith in God and their personal capabilities, and indifference to difficulties and obstacles, which greatly impressed the Egyptians, so they were not attacked or looted in most cases.
            
            After the collapse of the Byzantine Empire in the fifteenth century AD, the Russian czars declared themselves major patrons of the Christian Orthodox religion. And the monastery of St. Catherine in Sinai turned into their special care, until in 1689 Russia officially announced its patronage of the monastery, because Catherine is considered one of the most worshiped saints in Russia. It should be noted that the Order of St. Catherine was the highest decoration awarded to Russian women before 1917. In commemoration of this event, a Manufacture of a special sarcophagus for the remains of St. Catherine, which is kept so far in the altar of the Orthodox Church in Deir el-Sinai.
            
            It was believed, until not long ago, that one of the icons, by the painter Saint Andrei Rublyov, was kept in the monastery of Saint Catherine. It became clear at the end of the twentieth century that the oldest icon preserved in the monastery dates back to the sixteenth century only, bearing in mind that the painter Saint Andrei Rublyov lived at the end of the fourteenth century and the beginning of the fifteenth century. But before the mid-nineteenth century, the Sinai monastery possessed a very rare masterpiece that can be compared to the Vaticanâ€™s masterpieces, a manuscript of the Old and New Testaments in ancient Greek dating back to the fourth century AD, which was found in the monastery of St. Catherine. The monks of the monastery handed over the manuscript to Russia for study, provided that it was later returned to the monastery. But the manuscript was not written to return to its original place because Russia did not want the Bush of Moses to return it to the monastery. Negotiations began with the pastor of the monastery, which resulted in the signing of an agreement to gift the manuscript, which was called the Sinai Charter, to Russia. In 1869, the Russian Emperor Alexander II issued a decree granting the monastery a sum of 9,000 Russian rubles. This money was spent to set up a bell tower in the monastery. But Russia no longer owns this manuscript because the Soviet government sold it in 1933 to the British Museum for 100,000 pounds.
            
            It is worth noting that the monastery was able to preserve, in addition to this sacred manuscript, a large number of rare and very valuable books and manuscripts, including ancient manuscripts in Russian dating back to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and excerpts from Christian manuscripts in the ancient Georgian language dating back to the ninth and tenth centuries AD.
            
            Finally, the monastery of St. Catherine is famous for its bush of Moses, which is mentioned in the Old Testament and which grows here inside its walls near Mount Sinai. The bush of Moses attracts pilgrims from all over the Christian world who come to the monastery to worship it.<div class="mapouter"><div class="gmap_canvas"><iframe width="600" height="500" id="gmap_canvas" src="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=St.%20Catherine's%20Monastery&t=&z=13&ie=UTF8&iwloc=&output=embed" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe><a href="https://123movies-to.org"></a><br><style>.mapouter{position:relative;text-align:right;height:500px;width:60%;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;}</style><a href="https://www.embedgooglemap.net">iframe google maps</a><style>.gmap_canvas {overflow:hidden;background:none!important;height:500px;width:600px;}</style></div></div></p>
