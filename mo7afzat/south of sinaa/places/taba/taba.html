        <p class="card__text">The museum includes nearly 700 artifacts from different eras, including some of the antiquities that Egypt recovered from Israel, as Taba is the only outlet to enter South Sinai, and it is of an important strategic location in addition to its tourist importance, due to its historical importance.

            It was necessary to set up a museum for this open tourist village, which includes a beautiful collection of manuscripts and antiquities recovered from Israel after the occupation period and the October War.
            
            The idea of ​​the museum came in 1994 after receiving the occupied land of Taba, with the view that the museum would be a civilizational feature of Egypt, as it includes, in addition to the artifacts of the Sinai region, some documents that Egypt relied on in the international arbitration case. It was reinforced with some pieces that represent the ancient Egyptian "Pharaonic" civilization. As for the Islamic and Coptic exhibits, they are the results of excavations that were carried out in Sinai.
            
            The museum also includes a group of Ayyubid manuscripts that were found during the occupation period, as well as one of the important letters of Saladin, in addition to the armor of a warrior found on the top of the hill facing the island.
            
            The museum includes a group of the most beautiful and unique pieces that were found in the excavations of the Japanese mission in the city of Al-Tur, which are Islamic artifacts dating back to the Ayyubid, Ottoman and Mamluk eras, and some of the effects of the Egyptian excavation mission in Sinai, dating back to the Greco-Roman era and late ages, and a mosaic floor found in the Bluesun area.
            
            The display scenario in the Taba Museum proceeds according to the historical sequence and the similarity of the display material, starting from the Pharaonic era, passing through the Greco-Roman, Coptic and Islamic, provided that some parts of the museum are dedicated to the specialized display of tools for daily use of “pottery - ornamental tools” in addition to the recovered antiquities.<div class="mapouter"><div class="gmap_canvas"><iframe width="600" height="500" id="gmap_canvas" src="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Taba%20Grand%20Museum&t=&z=13&ie=UTF8&iwloc=&output=embed" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe><a href="https://123movies-to.org"></a><br><style>.mapouter{position:relative;text-align:right;height:500px;width:60%;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;}</style><a href="https://www.embedgooglemap.net">iframe google maps</a><style>.gmap_canvas {overflow:hidden;background:none!important;height:500px;width:600px;}</style></div></div> </p>
