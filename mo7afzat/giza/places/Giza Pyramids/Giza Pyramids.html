        <p class="card__text"><h2>Giza pyramid complex:</h2>
            It is an archaeological site on the Giza plateau in Greater Cairo in Egypt. The complex includes the Great Pyramid, the Pyramid of Khafre and the Pyramid of Menkaure, along with their associated pyramid complexes and the Sphinx. These pyramids were all built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of ancient Egypt between 2600 and 2500 BC. The site also includes several tombs and the remains of a workers' village.
            
            The complex is located on the fringes of the Western Desert about 9 kilometers (5.6 mi) west of the Nile in the city of Giza, and about 13 kilometers (8 mi) southwest of downtown Cairo. The site (along with the neighboring city of Memphis) was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979.
            
            The Great Pyramid and the Pyramid of Khafre are two of the largest pyramids built in ancient Egypt, and they were historically popular as symbols of ancient Egypt in the Western imagination. They became famous in Hellenistic times, when the Great Pyramid was listed by the Greek poet Antipater as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. They are by far the oldest and only ancient wonders of the world still surviving.
            
            The pyramids, according to one of the hypotheses, are royal tombs, each bearing the name of the king who built it and was buried in it. The pyramidal building is a stage in the development of tomb architecture in ancient Egypt. It started with a small pit that turned into an underground room and then into several rooms topped by a terrace. Then it evolved to take the form of a stepped pyramid by the engineer Imhotep, the minister of the pharaoh and King Djoser in the Third Dynasty. This was followed by two attempts by King Sneferu, founder of the Fourth Dynasty, to build a complete pyramidal form. But the backs of the two pyramids are improper, and they are located in Dahshur, one of them is flat at the base and the other has a smaller shape, approximately half the size of the first. The engineer Hamiono, the engineer of King Khufu, was able to achieve the ideal pyramidal shape and built the pyramid of Khufu in Giza on an area of ​​13 acres, followed by the pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure.
            <h2>Building:</h2>
            The construction of the Great Pyramid took nearly twenty years and the construction of the corridors and the lower parts of the pyramid ten years, according to Herodotus, the Greek historian who visited Egypt in the fourth century BC, after more than 2,000 years of building the pyramid and heard these and other stories from some priests and narrators. The stones that were used in the construction of the Great Pyramid from the area surrounding the pyramid, the stones of the outer cladding from the area of ​​Jabal Tora, and the granite stones used in the inner rooms from the Aswan quarries, and they were brought by the Nile River, which was reaching the pyramid area at that time. The stones were cut and separated from each other by making holes at close distances in the piece of stone to be cut, then some wooden pegs were hammered in them and hammered on them while putting water on them. buffing and polishing them using a stronger type of stone such as granite or diorite. The ancient Egyptians used a sandy road to build the pyramids, where pieces of stones are placed on wooden sledges beneath which are round palm trunks that work like wheels. From top to bottom and gradually remove the sand.
            
            <h2>Why the hierarchical shape?</h2>
            The hierarchical form of the ancient Egyptians was associated with the idea of ​​the emergence of the universe, and they also believed, according to some of their writings and religious texts, that the pyramid was a means to help the soul of the deceased reach the sky with the god Ra. that can help them ascend to heaven. We also see the pyramidal shape at the top of the obelisks and some small tombs of individuals in southern Egypt, even when the kings of the modern state thought of building their tombs on the western mainland in the Valley of the Kings and carving them in the bottom of the mountain to protect them from theft, they did not abandon the pyramidal shape, which was represented at the top of the mountain itself. .
            
            <h2>pyramids and Sphinx:</h2>
            The Giza pyramid complex consists of the Great Pyramid (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or Khufu and erected around 2580 - 2560 BC), the somewhat smaller Pyramid of Khafre, located a few hundred meters to the southwest, and the relatively modest Pyramid of Menkaure, a few Hundreds of meters to the southwest. The Great Sphinx is located on the eastern side of the complex. Most Egyptologists today agree that the head of the Great Sphinx is that of King Khafre. In addition to these main monuments, there are a number of small monuments affiliated with it, known as the pyramids of "queens", bridges and valley pyramids.<div class="mapouter"><div class="gmap_canvas"><iframe width="600" height="500" id="gmap_canvas" src="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Giza%20pyramids&t=&z=13&ie=UTF8&iwloc=&output=embed" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe><a href="https://123movies-to.org"></a><br><style>.mapouter{position:relative;text-align:right;height:500px;width:60%;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;}</style><a href="https://www.embedgooglemap.net">iframe google maps</a><style>.gmap_canvas {overflow:hidden;background:none!important;height:500px;width:600px;}</style></div></div></p>
