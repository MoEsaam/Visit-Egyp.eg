        <p class="card__text">The Grand Egyptian Museum , also known as the Giza Museum, is an archaeological museum under construction in Giza, Egypt. When inaugurated, the GEM will be the largest archaeological museum in the world. It will house artifacts of ancient Egypt, including the complete Tutankhamun collection; many pieces will be displayed for the first time. The museum is sited on a plot of land of about 480,000 square metres (5,200,000 sq ft)approximately 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) from the Giza pyramid complex and is part of a new master plan for the Giza Plateau called Giza 2030.

            The construction of the museum, carried out by a joint venture established by the Belgian company BESIX Group and the Egyptian company Orascom Construction, was scheduled to be completed in 2021. The opening of the museum had also been announced for 2021,however it has since been delayed again to November 2022.
            <h2>Overview:</h2>
            The building design was decided by an architectural competition announced on 7 January 2002. The organisers received 1,557 entries from 82 countries, making it the second largest architectural competition in history. In the second stage of the competition, 20 entries submitted additional information on their designs. Judging was complete by 2 June 2003. The competition was won by architects Róisín Heneghan and Shi-Fu Peng, and their company Heneghan Peng Architects (Ireland) winning 250,000 dollars. Second place was awarded to Coop Himmelblau. Héctor Vigliecca and Luciene Quel (Brazil), Ruben Verdi (Italy), Michael Zimmermann, Engel und Zimmermann (Germany), Fernando Pardo Calvo y Bernardo Garcia Tapia, Nuno Filipe Morais Monteiro (Portugal) and Martin Roubik (Czech Republic) received Honorable Mention. The building is designed by Heneghan Peng Architects, Buro Happold and Arup. The landscape and site masterplan was designed by West 8, The exhibition masterplan, exhibition design and museology is by Atelier Brückner.
            
            The building is shaped like a chamfered triangle in plan. It sits on a site 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) west of the pyramids, near a motorway interchange. The building's north and south walls line up directly with the Great Pyramid of Khufu and the Pyramid of Menkaure. In front of the building is a large plaza, filled with date palms. One of the main features of the museum is the translucent stone wall, made of alabaster, that makes up the front façade of the building. Inside the main entrance is a large atrium, where large statues will be exhibited.
            
            On 2 February 2010, Hill International announced that Egypt's Ministry of Culture had signed a contract with a joint venture of Hill and EHAF Consulting Engineers to provide project management services during the design and construction of the Grand Egyptian Museum.
            
            The total estimated project cost is US$550m, US$300m of which will be financed from Japanese loans, the remaining will be financed by the Supreme Council of Antiquities, other donations and international funds.
            
            The new museum is designed to include the latest technology, including virtual reality. The museum will also be an international center of communication between museums, to promote direct contact with other local and international museums. The Grand Egyptian Museum will include a children's museum, conference center, training center, and workshops similar to the old Pharaonic places.
            <h2>Exhibits:</h2>
