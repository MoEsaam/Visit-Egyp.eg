        <p class="card__text">The Sphinx is a statue of a mythical creature with a lion's body and a human head, carved from limestone, and it is likely that it was originally covered with a layer of plaster and colored, and traces of the original colors are still visible next to one of its ears.

            Located on the Giza plateau on the west bank of the Nile in Giza, Egypt, the Great Sphinx is also the guardian of the plateau. It is the oldest known colossal sculpture, with a length of about 73.5 meters, including 15 meters in length for its front feet, 19.3 meters in width, and its highest height from the surface of the earth about 20 meters to the top of the head. It is believed that the ancient Egyptians built it during the reign of King Khafre (2558 BC - 2532 BC), the builder of the second pyramid in Giza.
            The head of the Sphinx.
            It is believed that the statue of the Sphinx was quarried before King Khafre thought of sculpting it in the form of a statue, and this statue looks towards the east, so the original sides were changed in the last century to match the view of the Sphinx.
            <h2>Building:</h2>
            The Great Sphinx is a statue carved from one of the rocks of the Giza plateau, which also served as a quarry for the Giza pyramids and other monuments in the area. The limestone nimolite of the area consists of layers with different resistance to wind erosion, which explains the uneven deterioration apparent in the body of the Sphinx. The lower body, including the legs, is made of solid rock. As for the rest of the animal's body up to its neck, it consists of softer layers that have undergone great disintegration. The layer in which the head is carved is much more difficult. A number of "clogged" columns are known to exist within and below the body of the Great Sphinx, most likely excavated by treasure hunters and grave robbers prior to 1925. A carved headdress added during the New Kingdom period.
            
            <h2>Names:</h2>
            It is impossible to determine what name the builders of the Sphinx gave their statue, as the Sphinx does not appear in any known inscription of the ancient Egyptian kingdom and there are no inscriptions anywhere describing its construction or its original purpose. In the New Kingdom of Egypt, the Sphinx is venerated as the solar deity Hor-im-akhit (Arabic: Horus on the Horizon), (Coptic: ϩⲁⲣⲙⲁϣⲓ), (Hellenic: Harmashis).
            
            The commonly used name "Sphinx" was given to it in classical antiquity, some 2,000 years after the generally accepted date of its construction. The name Sphinx is a reference to the Greek mythological beast Sphinx with the head of a human, falcon, cat or sheep and the body of a lion with the wings of an eagle. (Although the Great Sphinx, like other Egyptian sphinxes, has the head of a man and does not have wings like the Greek Sphinx.) The English word sphinx comes from the ancient Greek word sphinx, after the Greek mythical being.
            
            <h2>Creator and timeframe:</h2>
            Although there has been conflicting evidence and viewpoints over the years, the view held by modern Egyptology still indicates that the Great Sphinx was built around 2500 BC by King Khafre, the builder of the second pyramid at Giza.
            
            Salim Hassan, writing in 1949 about the recent excavations of the Great Sphinx, summed up the problem:
            
            « All things considered, it seems that we should give credit for the erection of this statue, the most magnificent statue in the world, to Khafre, but always with this reservation: there is not a single contemporary inscription connecting the Sphinx with Khafre. Therefore, as it may seem, we must treat the evidence as circumstantial, until such time as the role of fortune in a spade will reveal to the world a definite reference to the erection of the Sphinx.”
            The circumstantial evidence cited by Hassan includes the location of the Sphinx in the context of the funerary complex surrounding the second pyramid, which is traditionally associated with Khafre. Apart from the Highway, the Pyramid and the Sphinx, the complex also includes the Temple of the Sphinx and the Temple of the Valley, both of which display a similar design to their inner courts. The Sphinx Temple was built using blocks cut from the Sphinx's barn, while Valley Temple blocks were torn from the plateau, some weighing up to 100 tons.
            
            A diorite statue of Khafre, discovered upside down with other debris in the Valley Temple, is claimed to support Khafre's theory.
            
            The Sphinx erected by King Thutmose IV, linking the Sphinx to Khafre. When the painting was discovered, its texts were damaged and incomplete, and only Khaf was mentioned, not Khafre. Excerpt translated:
            
            « Which we bring to him: oxen ... and all the little vegetables; We will commend Winover ... "Fear" ... the statue made for "Atum-Hor-im-Akhit"
            Egyptologist Thomas Young found the hieroglyphic "Khaf" in a damaged cartouche used to surround a royal name, and inserted the glyph "Ra" to complete the name Khafre. When the obelisk was re-excavated in 1925, the lines of text referring to "Fear" were cut and shattered.
            <h2>Loss of nose and beard:</h2>

            The nose of the face, which is one meter wide, is missing. Examination of the Sphinx's face shows that long sticks or chisels were driven into the nose, one down from the bridge and the other below the nostril, then used to project the nose toward the south. Mark Lehner, who conducted an archaeological study, concluded that it was broken with tools at an unknown time between the third and tenth centuries AD.

            Drawings of the Sphinx by Frederic Louis Norden in 1757 showed that the nose was missing. There are many folk tales about the destruction of his nose. One tale erroneously attributes it to the cannonballs fired by Napoleon Bonaparte's army. Other tales attributed to it being the work of the Mamluks. Since the 10th century, some Arab authors have claimed that it was the result of iconoclast attacks.

            The Arab historian al-Maqrizi, writing in the fifteenth century CE, attributes the loss of the nose to Muhammad Sa'im al-Zuhr, a Muslim Sufi from Khanaqah Sa`id al-Sa`d in 1378 CE, who found local peasants making offerings to the Sphinx in the hope of increasing their yield and thus disfigured the Sphinx by icon-smashing. According to al-Maqrizi, many residents of the area believed that the increase in sand covering the Giza plateau was retaliation for the noon act of defamation. Ibn Qadi mentions a Shahba named Muhammad ibn Sadiq ibn al-Muhammad al-Tabrizi al-Masri, who died in 1384 CE. He attributed the desecration of the Sphinx in the boyhood arches built by Sultan Baybars to him, and he also said that he may have desecrated the Great Sphinx. Abd al-Salam al-Munufi mentioned that the Crusade against Alexandria in 1365 was a divine punishment for breaking the nose of a Sufi sheikh in Khanqah Sa`id.

            Limestone fragments of the beard of the Great Sphinx in the British Museum, 14th century BC.
            In addition to the missing nose, an ancient Egyptian beard is believed to have been attached, although it was added at later periods after the original construction. Egyptologist Vasyl Dobrev suggested that if the beard was an original part of the Sphinx, it would have damaged the statue's chin when it fell. The absence of visible damage supports his theory that the beard was a later addition.

            Remains of red pigment appear on the areas of the Sphinx's face. Traces of yellow and blue pigment were found elsewhere in the Sphinx, leading Mark Lehner to suggest that the monument "was decorated in flashy comic book colors".
            <h2>legends:</h2>
            Colin Reader suggested that the Sphinx was the focus of sun worship in the Early Dynastic period, before the Giza Plateau became a cemetery in the Old Kingdom of Egypt (2686 BC-2134 BC). He linked this to his conclusions that the Sphinx, the Temple of the Sphinx, the bridge, and the mortuary temple of Khafre are all part of a complex that predates the Fourth Egyptian Dynasty (2613 BC - 2494 BC).

            In the New Kingdom of Egypt, the Sphinx became more specifically associated with the sun god Hor-im-Akhet (Hellenic: "Harmachis") or "Horus-in-the-horizon". King Amenhotep II (1427 BC-1401 BC) built a temple to the northeast of the Sphinx nearly 1,000 years after its construction and dedicated it to the cult of Horem Akhet.

            Some of the ancient non-Egyptians saw that he resembles the god Horon. The cult of the Sphinx continued into the Middle Ages. The Sabeans of Harran saw that it was the burial place of Hermes of Hermes. Arab authors described the Sphinx as a talisman guarding the region from the desert. Al-Maqrizi describes it as the "mantra of the Nile" on which the locals believed the flood season depended. Al-Idrisi stated that those wishing to obtain bureaucratic positions in the Egyptian government gave him an offering of incense.
            <h2>Reviews about it:</h2>
            Opinions differed as to what this statue represents. The old opinion is that it represents King Khafre, combining the strength of the lion and the wisdom of man. Some archaeologists believe that King Khufu was the one who built it, as the face of the Sphinx resembles a statue of Khufu, (and does not resemble the statues of Khafre). In fact, the question of who built the Sphinx is still open to research.

            It is said that he represents the god of the sun, "Hor-im-Akhit", and evidence of that is the temple facing the statue, where religious rites were taking place for him. This has remained firmly rooted in the minds of the Egyptians throughout their history, as they considered it a statue of the god "Hoor-em-akhit", (ie, Horus on the horizon), an image of the god Atum, the largest of the Egyptian gods, which is the sun at sunset. He was visited by more than one of the Egyptian kings and this was inscribed on the occasion of the visit, including Ramses II II. And King Tutankhamun, who set up a break next to the Sphinx. King Ramses II was before Tutankhamun, as the father-in-law of Tutankhamun is Amenhotep IV, who changed his name to Akhenaten when he called for the unification of the gods under the name of the god Aten, who symbolized him by the sun disk. , whose worship was common in Egypt and the center of his temples was in Luxor. In the Roman era, Emperor Septimius Severus visited him.
