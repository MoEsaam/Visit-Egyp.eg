        <p class="card__text">The step pyramid of King Djoser is considered one of the most famous and most famous monuments in Egypt, and it constitutes an important historical turning point in the ancient Egyptian funerary monuments. It is also considered a revolution in stone architecture and royal burial. In addition to its huge size, it is the first pyramid built by the ancient Egyptians and the oldest known stone building.

            The age of the building of the step pyramid dates back to the beginning of the Third Dynasty, during the reign of King Natracht (2627-2648 BC), now known as Djoser, which is the most common.
            
            Prior to his reign, Egyptian kings and elites were buried in mastabas. The term "mastaba" refers to a type of funerary structure that was generally rectangular in shape and built over a burial pit, which was underground. The step pyramid consists of six terraces that give the stepped shape, and perhaps the engineer Imhotep was the owner of this great innovation.
            
            At one end of the hierarchical group is a building known as the Southern Cemetery, which is considered a symbolic tomb of King Djoser that may have reflected his role as king of Upper and Lower Egypt. and the renewal of his strength, and the stone chapels on the eastern side of the courtyard were used in this celebration, ensuring that the king would continue to renew his youth forever.
