        <p class="card__text">The Valley Temple is a temple that the ancient Egyptians built on the shore of the Nile near the pyramids and connected to them by a road called the “Process Road”. After the death of Pharaoh, his body was embalmed and his mummies prepared in the valley temple, then they were transported in a large procession to a temple directly next to the pyramid, called the Mortuary Temple. After performing religious rituals on the deceased, he was entered into the coffin room and placed in the coffin.

            The Valley Temple first appeared during the reign of Pharaoh Sneferu, and its construction continued until the end of the Twelfth Dynasty. It was built when the desert met the green land, and water channels were sometimes built for it.
            
            The valley temples were erected on a platform on the shore of the Nile or the shore of the artificial canal, to which belong a port and marine facilities. These installations were used to load barges and large ships. The temple contained niches in which statues of the deceased were placed. The temple also had stairs to climb over it and to complete some religious rituals.
            
            During the reign of Sneferu, the construction of a complete facility around the pyramid began, and at that time the priests of the ancient Egyptians transferred the performance of religious rituals and the movement of the dead in meeting with the gods from the pyramid area to the valley temple. Religious ceremonies were held in the pyramid area for the gods Soker and Hathor, and the area was decorated with the banners of Horus. .
            
            And the boats belonging to it. It is most likely that Pharaoh used to accept the celebrations and his statues in the valley temple. This was inherited from the era of the early Egyptian dynasties. .
            
            This is evidenced by the Abu Sir papyrus from the Egyptian Fifth and Sixth Dynasty, and from the lists of celebrations, as well as the presence of many statues of Menkaure in the valley temple belonging to his pyramid.

            One of the valley temples that has survived so far is the Temple of Khafre. This temple was built next to the Sphinx and connected to a paved path for processions with its pyramid located on the Giza plateau. Archaeologists also found other temples for the kings Menkaure, Sahure, (Nei Userre), Unas, Bibi II, Senusret II, and Amenemhat III. There were also other valley temples on the fertile land near the Nile but these have not been studied.
