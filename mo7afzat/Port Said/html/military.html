        <p class="card__text">The foundation of Port-Said Military Museum dates back to 1964, and commemorates the tripartite aggression on Port-Said city in 1956. The museum was inaugurated on the national day of Port-Said governorate on the 23rd of December, 1964. The museum went through renovations, maintenance and development and was reopened in 1978, after attaching an additional hall for displaying the collections of October War, then was reopened a second time on the 23rd of December, 2009. The museum targets documenting the acts of the tripartite aggression on Port-Said city, and witnessing the greatness and heroism of the people of Port-Said while defending their land. The museum was established on a space of 7000 square meters. The museum includes a garden for open-air museum displays, across from which lies the main construction which includes the display halls, the facilities, and the museum services.<br><Br>
            The museum recites the epic of Port-Said people's persistence and valor, while resisting the tripartite aggression of 1956, by displaying various collections of weaponry and equipment, which were used or captured during the 1956 and 1973 wars. The museum is divided into three sections, open-air showground, the permanent display showroom, and the temporary display showroom.<br><br>
