            Many of the people of Kafr El-Sheikh and a number of neighboring governorates are not aware of the existence of the Water Resources Research Station in Baltim, which has turned into a tourist attraction that some know and others do not. <br><br>
            The Water Resources Research Station in Baltim belongs to a branch of the National Institute of Marine Sciences and Fisheries in Alexandria under the direction of Dr. Suzan El-Hassanin Khalif. <br><br>
            The station is located in the north center of the Nile Delta between the two branches of the Nile River (Damietta Branch and Rashid Branch) and in the northeast of Lake Burullus, specifically in the city of Baltim, opposite the Damietta car park in the eastern parking lot in Baltim. He finds it in front of him in the eastern position. As for those coming from the international coastal road from the governorates of Damietta, Port Said, Beheira and Alexandria, they head to Baltim and find it opposite the eastern position. <br><br>
            This station was established in the sixties of the last century, for the purpose of environmental monitoring and fisheries development of Lake Burullus. <br><br>
            The station was developed by making a fresh water hatchery with four greenhouses with a total of 55 cement basins equipped with an artesian water source and aeration source, as well as a boiler. <br><br>
            The annex building of the Baltim Research Station was established and consists of 4 main sections, the first section is a “lecture hall, the second section is the Aquarium and includes a complete skeleton of the whale as well as mummifications and marine fossils, and the third section is “aquarium”, which includes glass aquariums for displaying marine and freshwater fish. And a marine water hatchery with 23 fiberglass tanks of different capacities, and the fourth section has a laboratory for the production of plant and animal plankton, as well as cement tanks for marine fish mothers. <br><br>
            The station includes six laboratories, a fish breeding lab (Aquaculture Division), a genetics and genetic engineering lab, aquaculture division, a marine pollution laboratory, a marine environment division, a chemistry lab, a marine environment division, and a fish biology lab, a fisheries division. and the Fisheries Economics and Statistics Laboratory "Fisheries Division". <br><br>
            Dr. Abdel Rahman Said Abdel Latif, head of the Fisheries Research Station in Baltim, said that the goal of establishing the aquarium and museum is to identify some of the aquatic wealth in Egyptian waters, including living creatures and shells, with the aim of serving the community and introducing members of the Egyptian community, especially school and university students, to water resources and encouraging them to preserve the necessity of preserving it. And guide them and draw their attention to the fact that it is a world in its own right, important and complementary to life on earth, and they can see it and enjoy watching it at any time of the year. The Aquarium and Museum of the Water Resources Research Station in Baltim has not been officially opened yet, and it is working experimentally on official working hours. <br><br>
            The head of the Water Resources Research Station in Baltim added that fish are among the oldest vertebrates found on Earth. The fossils indicated that the oldest fish fossil is 360 million years old, and fish are the most numerous vertebrates on the surface of the earth in terms of number and diversity. About twenty thousand species, most of them live in salt water. <br><br>
            He added that the Aquarium of the Baltim Water Resources Research Station contains a unique, wonderful and diverse group of marine and fresh fish, including koi fish, fantle, golden fish, angel fish, eel, sorditil fish, sea turtle, red-eared turtle, carp, tilapia and catfish, and recently a small indigo crocodile was received. <br><br>
            Abdul Latif said, the museum contains a rare and distinctive collection of stuffed organisms, shells, coral reefs and sponges, including: <br>
            The skeleton of a whale that was thrown into the Mediterranean by the waters of the Mediterranean on the beach in front of the village of Mastrowa in Burullus in Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate in 2008. It is 15 meters long and weighs about 6 tons. The oceanic sunfish, which was found last March in Rashid, weighs about one ton and is five years old. The Diorama Museum of the Seabed, which is a miniature form that represents life inside the seabed of stones, marine creatures, and coral reefs. The museum includes felt fish, swords, sharks, groupers, seabass, morena snake, tuna, harid and starfish, as well as a group of stamp fossils. <br><br>
