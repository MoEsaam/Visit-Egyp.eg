            Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate is one of the most important governorates that enjoys a unique archaeological and heritage status, as it embraces the hill of the Pharaohs, which is located in the village of Abto in the center of Desouq. Prehistoric times known as - now - the Pharaohs hill, which is located on an area of 176 acres. <br><br>
            The importance of Bhutto is due to the fact that it was the city that gave legitimacy to the Pharaohs who came to it to complete their coronation ceremonies, as it is an important shrine of the most prominent tourist attractions in the northern Delta, specifically in Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate, where it comes to tourist delegations from various European countries and capitals. <br><br>
            The Pharaohs hill contains many artifacts that were discovered in this area, which was the ancient city of Bhutto, among these pieces, two basalt sphinxes dating back to the Pharaonic Twenty-ninth Dynasty, the statue of "Horus the Falcon", and the statue of King Ramses II standing in his hand. The left one is a holy staff wearing a priestly garb, a pink granite panel of King Shashang I of the Pharaonic dynasty, and a pink granite double statue of King "Ramses II" and Sekhmet. <br><br>
            This archaeological hill also includes a black granite plaque dating back to the era of King Tuthmosis II of the Pharaonic Thirteenth Dynasty, a statue of King Nayef Awred "Nefertiti I" of the Twenty-ninth Dynasty, a quartzite plaque of King Psamtik II, a double statue of King Ramses II and one of the His wives, and a double statue of smashed sandstone in the upper part of King Ramses II and one of his wives. <br><br>
            The scientific excavation missions focused on the city’s site, starting with the English mission that started working on the site from 1964 until 1969 AD, then the joint mission from the Faculty of Arts, Tanta University and the Egyptian Antiquities Authority, which began in 1982 and is still ongoing, in addition to the mission of the German Institute of Archeology that has worked on the site since 1982 AD. And also a mission of graduate students at the Archeology Department, Faculty of Arts, Kafr El-Sheikh University. <br><br>
