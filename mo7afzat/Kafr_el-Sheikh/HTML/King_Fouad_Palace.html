The king used to perform the rituals of prayer during his stay in Kafr El-Sheikh. <br><br>

            In 1961, this building was used as the headquarters of the General Office of Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate after its separation from the Gharbia until it became an independent governorate under local rule. In 1964, the governorate moved to its new building and this building was handed over to the Directorate of Education. <br><br>
