            The Burullus lighthouse is the second oldest iron tower in the world after the Eiffel Tower, and it is the only remaining lighthouse in Egypt among a group of lighthouses erected by Khedive Ismail on the occasion of the opening of the Suez Canal. <br><br>
            The Burullus lighthouse is of very great importance, as it guides ships at night through lenses located at the top of the lighthouse, and these lenses work to reflect light, and the strength of their signals on the Mediterranean side reaches about 30 km. <br><br>
            The lighthouse is located in the Burullus area (Baltim resort) and within the limits of Sheikh Mubarak village directly on the sea shore, where, when it was built, it is approximately one mile from the sea shore, but as a result of beach erosion, the distance has become about 120 m from the beach, and this distance has now been established almost after placing blocks Concrete to prevent erosion. <br><br>
            The Burullus area represents a peninsula, and Ras Baltim enters at a distance of between 48 and 35 km into the Mediterranean, so it was necessary to establish a lighthouse to guide ships to prevent them from colliding with this head of land in return for a fee of passage. <br><br>
            The lighthouse was established in 1869 by the French engineer Bercard, and it contained lenses at the top of the glass tower, and the lighting room worked with “kerosene”, and its signal range reached 17 nautical miles guiding the ships, and the lighthouse surrounded a group of rooms for the accommodation of employees and workers. Incorporated into the Antiquities Authority in 1998, it is now in a poor state of rust and corrosion of its metal plates, threatening to collapse. <br><br>
            For 120 years, the tower has been working non-stop, and throughout those years, annual periodic maintenance was conducted to restore it, and the only period in which it stopped working was during the 1967 war, immediately after the closure of the Suez Canal. <br><br>
            In Al-Fanar, there is a group of restrooms, numbering 18 rooms, which aims to provide comfort and accommodation for the administrative and technical staff of Al-Fanar. It was established in 1930. <br><br>
            “There is no money,” Salwa Al-Ra’i, Director of the Islamic and Coptic Antiquities Authority in Kafr El-Sheikh, justified the neglect reached by the oldest lighthouse in Egypt, threatening its downfall. <br><br>
            She stressed that the situation of Islamic antiquities began to witness an improvement during the last period after vigorous moves by officials of the Ministry of Antiquities with the governorate, to try to revive the antiquities and make them a tourist attraction frequented by visitors to the governorate, and that the situation will improve more during the next few period at all levels, and that the financial resources needed for restoration are The only drawback. <br> <br>
            Al-Rai added, during statements to Al-Fajr, that the lighthouse was included in the development process before its collapse, and there is a proposal to make it like the Cairo Tower, where visitors climb to take memorial photos and see Baltim and the sea more clearly. <br><br>
