            Qaitbay Castle in Alexandria, with its privileged location on the Mediterranean coast, was built more than 500 years ago over the ruins of one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the ancient Lighthouse of Alexandria. <br><br>
            Qaitbay Castle is one of the most beautiful military castles in the Mediterranean. The sultans and rulers of Egypt took care of it throughout the historical ages. <br> <br>
            The construction of the Qaitbay Citadel dates back to AH 882 / AD 1477, when Sultan al-Ashraf Abu al-Nasr Qaytbay ordered the construction of a great tower at the site of the ancient Lighthouse of Alexandria, at the eastern end of Pharos Island, according to the website of the Egyptian Ministry of Planning, Follow-up and Administrative Reform. <br><br>
            The reason for the construction of the citadel, whose construction was completed two years later in AH 884 / AD 1479, is to fortify the city of Alexandria and protect it from external aggression, specifically from the Ottoman Empire, which began to change the direction of its conquests from Europe to the East. Sultan Qaytbay tried to fortify the Egyptian frontiers, and began The construction of many castles, according to the website of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. <br><br>
            Speaking to CNN in Arabic, the Egyptian photographer, Mohamed Wardani, who documented the castle during his last visit in 2018, says that his passion for the history and civilization of Egypt prompted him to document this historical edifice through his own vision, to become a record for future generations. <br> <br>
            The photographer, who won many awards, was interested in documenting the idea of ​​establishing the castle over the remains of the stones of one of the Seven Wonders of the World mentioned by the Greeks, according to what he explained. <br> <br>
            Wardani points out that Qaitbay Castle is distinguished by its sea view and its strategic location, surrounded by the sea on three sides.
            Wardani believes that the most important feature of the castle from the inside is the "great engineering design" of the corridors and basements of the soldiers. <br><br>
            The castle was built on an area of 17,550 square meters, surrounded by the sea on three sides, according to the State Information Service website. <br> <br>
            The castle has a main entrance on the southwest side in the form of two towers in the form of three quarters of a circle, and includes two walls representing two defensive areas, according to the website of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. <br><br>
            The castle consists of three square floors, and in the four corners of the tower there are semi-circular towers that end at the top with prominent balconies. <br> <br>
            The first floor is occupied by the Citadel Mosque, which consists of a courtyard, four iwans, and defensive corridors that allow soldiers to pass easily during the operations of defending the citadel. This mosque had a minaret, but it collapsed recently, according to the website of the Central Administration for Tourism and Resorts in Alexandria. <br> <br>
            Wardani points out that the citadel includes a mosque that stands out for its importance as one of the oldest known mosques in Alexandria. <br> <br>
            As for the second floor, it contains corridors, halls and internal rooms, and the third floor includes a large room, “the seat of Sultan Qaytbay”, where he sits to see ships on a day’s journey from Alexandria covered by a cross vault, according to the website of the Central Administration of Tourism and Resorts in Alexandria. <br> <br>
            This floor also includes one of the ovens for preparing wheat bread, as well as a mill to grind grain for the soldiers residing in the castle. <br> <br>
            The castle has a huge fresh water storage tank for the use of residents of the castle, according to the website of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. <br>
