      <p class="card__text"> The ancient Library of Alexandria, which was built by Alexander the
        Great in ancient times, remains a memory today, but the modern 
        Library of Alexandria, which took its place and opened in 2002, 
        is a living example of the grandeur of this architecture, if it had 
        not existed among us until now! This architectural masterpiece is 
        more than just a large library, because it includes art galleries, 
        many museums, a planetarium, and others. We always discover 
        something new when we visit it every time!

        rich timber merchants, but has been turned into a museum in recent

        eat ice cream from Makram or Azza, especially during very hot summer 
        days, we advise you to visit the Qaitbay Citadel and take it to the 
        first place you go in Alexandria! Also, which
