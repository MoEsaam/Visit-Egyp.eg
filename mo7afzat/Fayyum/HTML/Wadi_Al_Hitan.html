            It is an area of fossils in the northwest of the Wadi El Rayan Reserve, dating back about 4 million years. These fossils are of fossilized skeletons of primitive whales, shark teeth, shells and other marine animals, which are considered an open museum. There is also a petrified shura plant inside soft rocks. <br><br>
            The importance of Wadi al-Hitan is due to it being a natural environment for endangered animals such as the white deer, the Egyptian deer, the Fennec fox, the sand fox, the wolf and rare migratory birds such as the Shaheen falcon, the deer falcon, the free falcon, the Eagle Eagle, and other types of migratory birds such as ducks, quails, falcons, herons, goats and others. Among the wild plants, such as: Al-Athel - White Rutatrit - Al-Aqoul - Al-Samar - Al-Ghab - Al-Baws - Al-Hurghaq - Halfa and others. <br><br>
            At the meeting of the World Heritage Committee hosted by the city of Durban, South Africa in July 2005, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) had registered the Wadi al-Hitan region in the list of nature reserves as the first Egyptian natural site and the first and sixth Arab site to be registered in the UNESCO list as a world natural heritage as a world natural heritage. It includes fossils of an extinct type of whale in the Western Desert of Egypt, which helped scientists to know the stages of the evolution of the life of this mammal, which turned over the years from a land organism to a marine organism. <br><br>
            Excavations conducted on the whales proved that whales were in the last stage of evolution, that is, before they changed their limbs to be able to live in the oceans. UNESCO said that the area contains a large number of fossils of whales, as it is unique in the degree of its quality that makes it unique. <br><br>
            The Wadi Al-Hitan region is characterized by a unique ecosystem in terms of the presence of wetlands, geological structures, water springs and rare fossils. There is also a large group of whale skeletons numbering 406, including 205 complete skeletons dating back 40 million years, in addition to the presence of many animals and fish. Others such as: sharks, bony fish, mermaids, and dolphins. This area is considered one of the most beautiful parts of the world due to the presence of small sandy hills and sandstone rocky outcrops of various shapes that give the area this global importance. <br><br>
            Wadi Al-Hitan represents a unique open geological museum of its kind and represents the geological “Mountain of Hell” of the Wadi Al-Hitan region. This area represents the bottom of the ancient sea, which was rich in natural resources in that era. It also contains one of the land areas that appeared above the surface of the water and the estuary point of one of the branches of the ancient Nile. In addition to the presence of many mangrove forests. <br><br>
            The excavations reflect the tropical environment of Egypt in the Eocene era, where fossils of bony fish, sharks, turtles, sea snakes, mermaids and the dinosaur species "Basilosaurus", which reach a length of about 22 meters, were found. <br> <br>
            It was decided to develop the Wadi al-Hitan area and to develop the optimal method to transform this area into an open museum for fossilized marine creatures, and to work to attract eco-tourism, scientific and geological. <br><br>
            And because the Wadi Al-Hitan area in Fayoum is far from the sea areas, some may not believe the existence of whales in that area, but the confirmed fact indicates the presence of a huge number of whales in addition to other types of fish, dolphins, mermaids and sea turtles. <br><br>
            This region was known as the Abu Sayyaf fish and the original ancestor of the whale, because it was originally the bottom of the Sidis sea, whose existence dates back to 42 million years ago. The problem that could face Wadi al-Hitan is facing the dangers of agricultural encroachment, in addition to threatening the extinction of many rare animals such as the white fox, the mink, and the Egyptian cobra. <br><br>
            In addition, there are some monasteries established by monks carved in the mountains where they have been established for centuries, and in these areas in general there are many marine fossils dating back to the Eocene era, the most prominent of which are neolith fossils or angel sharks and many snails and sea urchins. <br><br>
            In addition to these geological formations that can be seen in Wadi Al-Hitan and the surrounding areas in Wadi Al-Rayyan, many forms of plant and animal life can be observed in it. Also, the forms of animal and marine life are among the most important wealth of the valley, including mammals such as the Egyptian deer Dorcas, the white deer, the red fox, the fennec fox, the Egyptian wolf, the mongoose, the mountain cat, and others, in addition to 16 species of reptiles such as the animal of the mountain judge, the desert lizard, the red arqam and the gecko, and there are also A lot of birds that can be spotted in the valley, such as the winter charcoal, shaheen falcon, quail, ducks, gull, baluchin, basharush and eagle eagles. There are also a number of fish in the lakes of Wadi El-Rayan, such as tilapia, white crust, tubar, carp, bream, and others. Whale Valley or (Hell continent) as it was called in the past It is located within the Wadi El Rayan Reserve in the Egyptian desert of Fayoum, where the reserve contains a number of artificial lakes It is the newest in the world. In addition to these lakes, the reserve includes several other areas, such as the Al Mudawara Mountain area, the Qarat Jahannam area (the Whale Valley), the Oyoun Al Rayyan area, and the Jabal Al Rayyan area (Manaqir Al Rayyan). <br><br>
            It is believed that 40 million years ago, Wadi El-Rayan was located under a very huge ocean, and due to geological changes, this ocean receded back and left behind a large number of marine animals, including whales, which were observed to a large degree, and where hundreds of fossilized skeletons of some types of primary whales were discovered, as well as many Shells, sharks and other marine animals. Generally, Whale Valley is characterized by the presence of many of these fossilized organisms, which are located in several locations, including rocks containing structures of marine animals and areas with fossilized backbones of marine mammals and the remains of fossilized mangrove plants within soft rocks and others. <br><br>
            Some fossils of a whale were discovered and their time was determined, which brought it back to the Eocene era, i.e. 40: 42 million years ago. Expeditions continued to reveal the existence of skeletons of invertebrates, cows, sea turtles, crocodiles, teeth and jaws of sharks, as well as some types of extinct monkeys that were found on the mountains in The valley is like Jabal Al-Qatrani, as well as some types of elephants, whose time scientists have identified to two successive eras, namely the Eocene and the Alugosin. <br><br>
            These discoveries may have made Wadi al-Hitan a box of wonders and raised many questions about how these marine creatures reached the depths of the desert or hell, as some call this name for the valley. <br><br>
            Explanations for the existence of these organisms in this desert valley varied between scientific opinions of geologists and funny ones based on popular plantations and of course they have no scientific basis. Its sediments made a delta in which ancient elephants and some other vertebrates lived at the shore of the ancient Mediterranean, which was north of Fayoum. They also mentioned that the Red Sea had not yet arisen, and they affirmed that Jabal al-Mokattam was one of the deposits of the ancient Mediterranean and that Cairo itself was under its waters. <br><br>
            The other side of the interpretations is funny, as it clarified that these beings are the remnants of arrogant societies and peoples, who were discontented by God and caused the earth to descend upon them, and the Almighty and Exalted be He left these evidence to indicate them. It is certain that the year of these interpretations is the popular myths and legends that the simple and common people circulate to the extent that there are those who call this valley ( Wadi Al-Masakeet). In general, Wadi Al-Hitan or Hell or Al-Masakeet is the box of wonders, which days may reveal many of its treasures and mysteries. <br><br>
