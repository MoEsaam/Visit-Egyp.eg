On both sides of the room there was a group of rooms used to store the valuables of the temple and offerings Which was presented by the common people to the temple, and the temple was used to worship the god Sobek, who was embodied in the form of a crocodile, and his worship spread in Fayoum from the beginning of the first dynasty until the end of the Roman era and the beginning of the entry of Christianity into Egypt. <br><br>
            He added that the Genoese and northern temples are devoid of decorations and were built in the first century AD, and in the front of the temple there is an inscription directed by the Roman governor of Egypt dedicating the inscription from Emperor Nero to the god Sobek, in addition to another inscription in the gate adjacent to the temple from Emperor Fasvian to the god Sobek. <br><br>
