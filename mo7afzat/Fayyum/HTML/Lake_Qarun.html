            The Qarun pond in Fayoum Governorate is the largest and oldest natural freshwater lake in the world, and its area was in the past 10 times larger than its area now, as it covered the city of Fayoum, but it receded with the factors of time, and it is linked to the Nile River through the Yusuf Sea, which was built by King Amenemhat II in The 19th century BC, the Qarun Pond extended with the flood waters that originated from Dayrut in Assiut, through Minya and Beni Suef, until it reached Lake Qarun in Fayoum. <br><br>
            Barakat Qarun is located north of the city of Fayoum, with an area of about 600 square kilometers, while its coastline is about 50 kilometers long, and in some areas it reaches a depth of 14 meters, and is about 45 meters below sea level, after it receded over time. <br><br>
            The Greek historian Herodotus wrote about the pool of Qarun, in his manuscripts written in the fifth century BC, that the pool of Qarun stores water for 6 months, and supplies the land with water for another 6 months. <br><br>
            Historians confirmed that it has nothing to do with Qarun, with whom God eclipsed the earth, but it was called “Baron” during the days of the Pharaohs, then it was misrepresented and called Qarun Lake due to the large number of bays and centuries in it, and finally it was distorted to Qarun. <br> <br>
            Many scientists were puzzled during their study of the Qarun pond because its origin is river and fresh water, yet it includes salt water, and its bottom includes Nile and marine fish at the same time, in addition to vertebrates and red algae transferred from the Mediterranean Sea and adapted in the pond, which made it an important source of fish wealth. It includes dozens of fish species, the most important of which are tilapia, moose, mullet, bream, garumi, shrimp, catfish and eel. <br><br>

The reserve now includes 88 species of birds within the reserve, the most important of which are seagulls, hooks, falcons, falcons, flamingos, and Abu Mullaqah. ducks, in addition to 17 species of wild plants. <br><br>
            Hundreds of citizens from different governorates come to the village of Shakshuk, which is located on the banks of the Qarun pond and includes dozens of fish restaurants, which are distinguished by quality, cleanliness and good taste and at the same time, their prices are low and accessible to everyone, in addition to providing the "fried Berkawi shrimp" dish that characterizes Fayoum Governorate. , excluding others, due to the extraction of this type of pond from Qarun only. <br><br>
