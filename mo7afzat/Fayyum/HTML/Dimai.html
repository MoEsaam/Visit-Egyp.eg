            “Dimai El sebaa ” or the island of the crocodile god is a city from the Greco-Roman era with the remains of a small square stone temple, and the ruins of that city, its walls and its roads remain until now, including a “mudbrick wall that surrounded the city up to 10 meters high and 5 meters thick. <br><br>
            The city received great care in the era of Ptolemy II, where he worked on land reclamation and draining the waters of Lake Qarun in that region and witnessed prosperity that lasted for more than two centuries. However, the Ptolemies and their imposition of taxes led to the extinction of many cities in that region, while the ruins of this city remained. <br><br>
            Ahmed Abdel-Al, Director General of Fayoum Antiquities, explains that “Dimai El Sebaa” is located 3 kilometers from the shore of Lake Qarun North in Fayoum Governorate. It has traces of a small temple made of stone, and it is considered one of the oldest fishermen’s cities that used to live on fishing in Lake Qarun, and there is a 400-meter-long road that leads to the shore of the lake. Some of them were discovered, in addition to tunnels under the road, while an Italian mission is still working in the area, and another temple, older than the temple that was visible, was discovered, as previously several English and American missions were working in the city. <br><br>
            Mohamed Sayed, an archaeological researcher, points out that the mission of the Italian University of Salento Lecce discovered on the western side of the temple of the god “Scnobius” in the Dimiya al-Sabaa area, two complete statues in good condition in the form of a crouching lion dating back to the Ptolemaic era, each 60 cm long and 90 cm wide. Their height is 80 cm, and their facial features are very similar to nature, but they differ among themselves in terms of shape and details. <br><br>
