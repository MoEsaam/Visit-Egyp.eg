            About 8 kilometers north of Lake Qarun in the Egyptian city of Fayoum, southwest of Cairo, the Al-Sagha Palace is built of limestone and sand on an area of about 180 meters. Because it bears another name, "Qarun Palace", many stories and legends revolve around it about the reason for the name and to what era It belongs and the secrets of the rooms inside it. <br><br>
            The height of the 3-storey palace is about 13 meters, its width is about 19 meters, and its length is about 32 meters. There are conflicting accounts about the date of its construction between the Middle Kingdom and the ancient state of Pharaonic Egypt. <br><br>
            Magdy Shaker, chief archaeologist at the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities, recounts the history of the palace's construction, saying: "The archaeological palace dates back to the Ptolemaic period within the city of Dionysus, which was founded in the 3rd century BC, and during the Greco-Roman era the city gained great importance as it was a station for the exit of convoys to the oases. " <br><br>
            This palace, which some call the Temple of Qarun, was dedicated to the ancient Egyptians' god Sobek, the crocodile, and Dionysius, the Roman idol of love. <br><br>
            The legends of Qarun Palace <br>
            From the name to its architecture, legends revolved around the palace, and the chief Egyptian archaeologist says: “The name Qarun Palace goes back to its location, because the dry part of the lake was called Qarn, and there were many dry parts in Lake Qarun, and it was called Lake and Qarun Palace.” With time, the name was distorted and became Lake and Qarun Palace, which negates any connection to the effect with the person of Qarun who was mentioned in the Qur’an. <br><br>
            At the same time, some reported incorrect information related to the fact that part of the antiquity is buried underground, and that the apparent part is a small part of the building, in addition to the fact that there is a tunnel between the palace and the city of Alexandria in northern Egypt, which makes it impossible to leave the palace. <br><br>
            Shaker explains this narrator, saying: "The Qarun Palace site remained without excavation until 1984, when the French-Swiss mission visited it, and it carried out excavations and revealed a Roman bath and several houses decorated with distinct ornate murals explaining sun worship, in addition to revealing tools, pottery and remains of a castle. It is built of red bricks, surrounded by a limestone wall, and has 9 towers. <br><br>
            One of the legends mentioned that the palace contains 365 rooms with the number of days in one year, and the sun rises inside each room only once a year, which was proven wrong given that the number of rooms in the palace does not reach 100 rooms, and they were used to store and preserve grain. <br><br>
            Qasr Qarun is one of 14 archaeological sites in Egypt that witness the phenomenon of the sun perpendicular to it on a specific day of the year. <br><br>
            Dr. Magdy Shaker says: “On December 21 of each year, the phenomenon of the sun perpendicular to the Holy of Holies in the temple occurs, and the sun’s rays perpendicular to the main and right compartment only, and not perpendicular to the left compartment and the compartment containing the mummy of the crocodile (symbol of the god Sobek). To prevent the mummy from being harmed by the sun's rays." <br><br>
            And he explained the date of the sun’s perpendicular to the Holy of Holies, since it is a date that coincides with the winter transition, which witnesses the shortest day and longest night of the year, and Shaker added: “The temple consists of two halls that lead to the Holy of Holies, which consists of 3 chapels, and the middle cabin was where the sacred boat was placed, while it was Statues of deities are placed on the two side compartments. <br><br>
