        <p class="card__text">The Luxor Museum of Ancient Egyptian Art is set in an exceptional location in the ancient and world-famous town of Luxor, which lies nearly 670 kilometres south of Cairo, the capital, and has a population of approximately 70,000. The museum is situated in a superlative position on the Nile Corniche road which connects the Luxor and Karnak temples, parallel to the great River Nile and facing the Ramesseum on the west bank. The river traverses the town centre, thus dividing it into two sections.<br><br>
          The Luxor Museum is a place of major archaeological interest in Egypt, located in an area containing two-thirds of the country’s antiquities. It was therefore essential that its collection of exhibits should be rich and varied enough to show all aspects of the history and art of Luxor. The museum administration therefore proposed expansion of the exhibition rooms and extension of the museum so that acquisitions stored in the area and unearthed by excavation in successive seasons could be added to it. The Higher Council of Antiquities responded favourably to this proposal and the process of expansion is now under way.<br><br>
          The excavations in the region uncover, sometimes by mere chance, unique artefacts, which should be exhibited in the museum for the world to see. Such artefacts may be in urgent need of rapid intervention in the interests of their restoration and preservation so that they can be suitably exhibited. In that connection, the museum faces a number of difficulties, as there is no workshop where restoration and preservation work can be carried out using the modern tools and equipment essential for treating the condition of such artefacts. A request has been submitted for the establishment of an integral workshop in the new wing. Despite the lack of a specialist workshop, however, there are anumber of expert restorers who are well qualified to handle antiquities on the basis of their raw material or condition. If local resources are incapable of caring for an artefact, help is sought from specialists in the central museum administration in Cairo.<Br><BR>
            The main antiquities on exhibition in the museum include the statue of King Tuthmosis III of the 18th dynasty (1490–36 B.C.). Made of green slate, this statue was discovered in 1904 in the Karnak temple cache north of the seventh pylon in this famous temple. As the town had no museum, the statue was sent to Cairo for exhibition at the Egyptian Museum with other discoveries from the cache. It was then returned to its place of origin when the Luxor Museum opened. This particular statue is regarded as one of the museum’s main acquisitions and is the one that provokes most comment from visitors, as the King’s noble facial features convey his confidence in himself as a ruler and god, the Egyptian sculptor having masterfully succeeded in bringing out that particular expression, thus making this statue one of the most beautiful pieces of ancient Egyptian art.<br><Br>
              The site of the Luxor Museum continues to reveal its secrets. The most recent discovery, and also the most important of the penultimate decade of the twentieth century, was made in the hypostyle hall of Amenhotep III, the builder and founder of the Luxor temple (1403–1365 B.C.), where a collection of rare statues known as the Luxor temple cache was uncovered<br><br>
              LUXOR MUSEUM One of the best displays of antiquities in Egypt is located at the Luxor Museum opened in 1975. Housed within a modern building, the collection is limited in the number of items, but they are beautifully displayed.<br><br>
              Upon entering the museum, there is a small giftshop on the right. Once inside the main museum area, two of the first items that catch one's attention are an enormous red granite head of Amenhotep III and the cow-goddess head from the tomb of Tutankhamun.<br><br>
              Spaced out around the ground floor are masterpieces of sculpture including a calcite double statue of the crocodile god Sobek and the 18th Dynasty pharaoh Amenhotep III (below right). It was discovered at the bottom of a water-filled shaft in 1967.<br><Br></p>
