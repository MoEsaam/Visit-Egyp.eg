        <p class="card__text">The area of Nubia is located between Aswan to the north and the city of Debba in Sudan to the south. It is strange that the name "Nubia" was never mentioned in the ancient Egyptian language and in fact it was first mentioned in a book called "Geographica" that was written by the Greek historian Strapon who visited Nubia in the first century A.D. The word Nubia is said to be derived from the word "Nebo', referring to the mines of gold which Nubia was famous for in ancient times.<br><br>
          The lands of Nubia remained the Egyptian gate to Africa for thousands of years. Nubia is mainly divided into two parts: lower Nubia which is located in Egypt and higher Nubia which is located inside Sudanese borders.<br><br>
          The museum was designed by Mahmoud Al-Hakim who succeeded in creating a museum in harmony with the surrounding setting of huge rocks, small mountains, and the shining sun of Aswan. The new Nubian Museum was opened in 1997 and the beautiful lines of its architecture alone make it well worth seeing. Nestled into the hillside at Aswan, it covers 50,000 square metres and includes landscaped gardens and buildings which are divided up into many different sections.<Br><Br>
            The museum is considered to be a gateway to the history of Nubia that enables visitors to understand the complex history of this unique area. Each exhibit has a description note underneath it written in Arabic and as well in English. The first place that attracts the attention of the visitor is the garden of the museum which hosts more than eighty historical statues and historical rocks, some of which are dedicated to the gods of ancient Nubia. There are also some artificial lakes and waterfalls that serve as a demonstration of the river Nile and its flow into the lands of Nubia<br><br>
            A lot of wild plants are cultivated in this area which is 34,000 meters large. This section also has a theatre that hosts regular Nubian dances for visitors to view this unique folkways of the Nubian people. There is a cave as well that contains ancient drawings.<br><br>
            The museum consists of two floors. The ground floor contains the main gates of the museum, exhibition halls, and visitors reception hall, while the first floor contains an information center, culture activities center, and another exhibition hall.<br><Br>
              When the visitor first enters the building of the museum, he or she has to walk in a circle to the left to go to the starting point of his tour which starts with the antiquities found in Nubia around 3500 B.C. The most important exhibits in this section include a bone comb with two giraffes carved on the handle, a vessel made out of an ostrich egg and decorated with incisions and a paleolithic ax.<br><BR>
                Afterward, we moved to the area the museum calls "Group A" which demonstrates the relationship between the people in southern Egypt and the people in Nubia which were built mainly on trading of raw materials, wood, and ivory. It is clear that there was a trading center on Elephant Island. The most important displays of this section are a polished quartz cosmetic palette used for crushing galena powder whch was used for eye makeup and a vessel decorated with a rowing boat with multiple oars, ostriches and undulating lines symbolizing water.<BR><BR>
                  We then go to the section "Group C" that tells the story of the new civilization that started in Nubia after the decline of the Sixth Pharaonic Dynasty, or the decline of the period of pyramid building. There isn't accurate evidence that would tell us the origin of the tribes that started this civilization but they came most probably from the Western desert. Exhibits of this section include Female figurine typical of the C group style, (dated c.a. 1900 - 1550 BC) and inscribed "basket" pottery.<br><BR>
                    The next section demonstrates Nubia during the Ptolemaic and Roman era who ruled at the same time as the Meroitic civilization and both kingdoms held good relations together until the Ptolemies were able to take control of a part of lower Nubia where they constructed a number of popular monuments like the temples of Philae, Kalabsha, and Dekka.<br><br>
                    The most important Christian displays in the Nubia Museum include a wooden Coptic cross, a Coptic prayer book that contains Coptic inscriptions, Byzantine-style fresco from the church of Abdalla Nirqi, 10th century, and a Fragment of a linen shroud depicting a human face<Br><BR>
                      When the Moslems opened Egypt in 641 AD, Islam became the official religion in Egypt. However, in Nubia Islam took some time to replace the dominant Christian beliefs. It wasn't until the 16th century when most of the Nubian people changed their religion to become Moslems. This Islamic section includes a child's tunic from the Fatimid period, a tombstone from the Fatimid period, 968-1070 A.D. and a water vessel from the Mamluk period.<br><br></p>
