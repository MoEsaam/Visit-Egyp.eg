        <p class="card__text">There is a historical problem in determining the time period to which these wells belong. It is believed that they date back in their current form to the Byzantine era. The wells are constructed of local limestone, a very poor quality stone that needs constant maintenance and restoration.<br><br>
          Today, only five of these twelve springs remain, as the rest of the springs were buried due to lack of attention and maintenance, which led to the spread of algae and reed trees. A sign was placed next to each eye with the name of the eye and its depth. The local Bedouins gave many names to the discovered wells, such as: (Bir al-Zuhr) The sea well, the western well, the well of al-Shayeb, the well of the sheikh, the well of al-Saqia, and the well of al-Baqabaqa), and the water currently only comes out from one well, the well of the sheikh, and the average depth of the eyes is about 40 feet, and a project is now underway to develop and beautify these eyes, where the surrounding area will be planted and the eyes restored The remaining building and an exhibition beside it contains the antiquities that were found in this place.<br><br></p>
        <p class="card__text">The fortified point of Oyoun Musa is located close to the Oyoun Musa area, which is one of the sites used by the Israeli army before the October 1973 war, as it took control of the northern part of the Gulf of Suez. Orders to attack and seize it because of its importance, so that the Israeli forces withdrew, leaving behind the site with all its weapons and equipment.<br><br>
          The site of the stronghold in Uyun Musa consists of six reinforced concrete dams with thick walls covered with railroad tracks, and above them are chains of rocks and stones that can withstand 1,000-pound bombs, surrounded by two bands of barbed wire and equipped with an electronic warning network, each with a 155 mm howitzer and a steel door There are places designated for the accommodation of soldiers and commanders, linked by transportation trenches and topped with observation points and administrative and medical facilities. This point is self-sufficient, which suffices for a month.<br><br>
