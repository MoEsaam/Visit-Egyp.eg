            The idea of ​​the Sand Museum is unique, as it is the first of its kind in the Middle East and North Africa. What gave this museum distinction is that it collects 42 statues that embody many civilizations, and all the statues were made and carved from sand by more than 40 international sculptors from different countries, including Russia, Turkey, Germany, America and others. About 12,000 tons of sand were used, in addition to 15,000 tons of water, which took 7 months to finish.
            
            <h2>What are the statues made in the Sand Museum:</h2>
            
            The sculptors used Egyptian sands known as yellow sands and also white sands. These sands are characterized by low salinity, and to increase the preservation of the statues, they put an adhesive substance before placing the sand cubes, which in turn prevents sand from falling.
            
            
            There are ongoing periodic restoration work for these statues by technicians and experts because of the weather changes they are exposed to.
