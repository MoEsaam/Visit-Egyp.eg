        <p class="card__text">The Leaning Pyramid of Sneferu or the Curved Pyramid is one of the pyramids of Egypt and one of three pyramids built by Sneferu. It was called the leaning pyramid, as it started building the pyramid to ascend at an angle of 58 degrees, and when the building of the pyramid reached about half its height, it was decided to build the upper part at an angle of 43 degrees. This technique benefited Sneferu and his engineers to build a complete pyramid with a new technology in the town of Dahshur next to it called the Red Pyramid.

            It took 14 years to build the leaning pyramid, and it seems that Sneferu did not like it, so he decided to build the red pyramid according to the experience learned by its engineers when building the leaning pyramid. He chose the place for his burial, about 2 km north of the leaning pyramid in the town of Dahshur.
            
            When building the sloping pyramid, the pyramid was built of stones with diagonal angles relative to the ground estimated at 59 degrees. It is likely that by building the building in this way, the building began to sink because of the stone loads. In addition, the large angle causes a large sharp rise to the pyramid, making it difficult to work to complete it and build the upper part of it. To remedy this problem, the engineers built reinforcement walls that made the angle of inclination 55 degrees for the unfinished building. Then they completed the construction with a curved angle of 43 degrees, which made it called the curved pyramid. Thus, I discovered the technique of building the complete pyramids by laying horizontal floors of stones. Each square layer of stones is topped with a lower layer in area, provided that the angle of inclination is 52 degrees, instead of building at an angle of 55 or 43 degrees, as was the case in the case of the curved pyramid. And this shape became the complete shape of the pyramid as we know it today.
            
            
            <h2>Leaning pyramid building design:</h2>
            
            The Leaning Pyramid and next to it the Secondary Pyramid, the Red Pyramid (right) is visible from the distance.
            Sneferu, using the new technology, built his gigantic pyramid and named it the “Northern Pyramid,” which we call today the Red Pyramid. The Red Pyramid is located about 1.8 km north of the curved pyramid of Dahshur. And based on the technique of building the red pyramid of Sneferu, the pyramids were built in Giza. Khufu, son of Sneferu, built the Great Pyramid on the Giza Plateau and reached a height of 157 meters. Then his son Khafre followed him and built his pyramid next to his father's pyramid and it was lower than it. Then his son Menkaure came and built the third (small) pyramid, and the three pyramids are in Giza. Those pyramids were tombs for them.
            <h2>Overview:</h2>
            
            Archaeologists now believe that the curved pyramid represents a transitional shape between the stepped pyramid and the smooth pyramid. It has been suggested that due to the steepness of the original angle of inclination, the structure might begin to show signs of instability during construction, forcing builders to adopt a shallower angle to avoid structural collapse. This theory seems to be confirmed by the fact that the adjacent Red Pyramid was built, immediately afterwards by the same king, at an angle of 43 degrees from its base. This fact also contradicts the theory that construction at the initial corner would take a long time because Sneferu's death was approaching, so the builders changed the angle to complete the construction in time. In 1974, Kurt Mendelsohn suggested that the angle be changed as a security precaution in response to the catastrophic collapse of the Meidum Pyramid while it was still under construction.
            
            The reason Sneferu abandoned the Meidum pyramid and the curved pyramid could be due to a change in ideology. The royal tomb was no longer considered a staircase to the stars; Instead, it was presented as a symbol of the worship of the sun and the primeval hill from which life arose.
            
            It is also unique among the pyramids found in Egypt, as its original polished limestone outer shell is still largely intact. The British structural engineer Peter James attributes this to the fact that there are more spaces between the parts of the casing than those used in the later pyramids; These defects act like expansion joints and prevent the successive destruction of the outer shell by thermal expansion.
            
            <h2>The stages of building the pyramid:</h2>
            <h4>First construction phase</h4>
            In the first construction phase, a very steep pyramid with a base length of 157 meters and an angle of inclination of about 58 degrees (possibly even 60 degrees) was planned. If the pyramid had been completed in this way, it would have reached a height of about 125 m. The pyramid was erected in this way using the inclined layer technique that has been tried and tested in stepped pyramids. While this technique improved the stability of the stepped pyramids, as the infrastructure was at the bottom of the pyramid, it led to major problems with this pyramid, as the inclined positions increased pressure on the inside of the pyramid and in the rooms and in the pyramid’s body, the corridors led to stability problems, cracks and even the risk of collapse. . The building was probably only half fenced at this point when stability problems became apparent. Due to the good overall degree of preservation of the pyramid, this first construction phase can only be verified indirectly by offset points about 12.70 m from the entrance in the descending lower aisle and about 11.60 m in the upper descending aisle.
            
            <h4>Second construction phase</h4>
            To improve stability, the builders reduced the tilt angle to 54 degrees. For this purpose, a belt 15.70 m wide was built around the pyramid of the first construction phase. This increased the length of the base to 188 m. Here, too, slanted wall layers have been used again. Had the gradient of 54 degrees been observed, it would have reached a height of 129.4 meters and a volume of about 1,524,000 cubic metres. A grid pyramid will be the third highest pyramid in the world, but its volume will remain behind the Red Pyramid (1,694,000 cubic metres), so that it will be the fourth largest pyramid only in Egypt. However, since the construction problems could not be resolved through measures, the construction at the height of 49 & nbsp; was cancelled. M. The stone of this stage is covered with fine limestone.
            <h4>The third construction phase</h4>
            In the third construction phase, the angle was reduced to 43 degrees and the construction was laid in horizontal layers, just as in the Red Pyramid, relieving the pressure inside. This created a unique net that is not found in any other pyramid. Due to the lower angle of inclination of the upper part, the total height was reduced to 105 m. The total volume was 1,440,808 cubic metres. The upper area is also covered with fine torah limestone.

            <h4>construction problems</h4>
            The pyramid was built on stone from clay, not like most pyramids on solid rock. This may have been done to make it easier to work on the infrastructure, since it was easier to cut the slab. However, the subsoil did not provide sufficient support for the stone blocks of the pyramid, and a subsidence occurred, which can be seen through cracks in the pyramid's construction, especially in the corridors and rooms. Combined with the problems caused by the inward-sloping construction, this apparently led to doubts about the stability of the structure and thus the suitability of the structure as a tomb. The first attempts were made to cover the cracks in the walls of the corridors with plaster of Paris, later wooden beams were installed as supports in the rooms. It is clear that the quality of the building was not sufficient for the burial of the king, which most likely led to the fact that, slightly north, he commissioned another monument with the Red Pyramid. At the same time, he transformed the Meidum pyramid into a real pyramid. The curved pyramid itself was completed with a miniature temple program and presumably assumed the function of the cult pyramid of the northern red pyramid.
